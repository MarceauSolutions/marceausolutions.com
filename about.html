                            <h2 class="text-gold fw-bold mb-4">The Battle That Changed Everything</h2>
                            <p class="lead">At 17 years old, most teenagers are worried about college applications and prom.</p>
                            <p class="lead">I was fighting for my life.</p>
                            <p>Brain cancer doesn't ask permission. It doesn't care about your plans, your dreams, or your future. When the diagnosis came, everything stopped. The tumor had to be removed—there was no other choice.</p>
                            <p>The surgery was successful. The cancer was gone.</p>
                            <p>But recovery brought a new challenge: <strong>dystonia</strong>—a neurological movement disorder that causes involuntary muscle contractions. The very brain that had just been saved was now sending confused signals to my body.</p>
                            <p>Most people would have given up. Accepted limitations. Settled for less.</p>
                            <p class="text-gold fw-bold">I refused.</p>
                        </div>

                        <!-- The Comeback -->
                        <div class="mb-5">
                            <h2 class="text-gold fw-bold mb-4">The Comeback</h2>
                            <p>While battling dystonia, I didn't just recover—I <strong>transformed</strong>.</p>
                            <p>I taught myself:</p>
                            <ul class="lead">
                                <li>Advanced training techniques and nutrition science</li>
                                <li>How to push my body to pro athlete levels despite neurological challenges</li>
                                <li>The discipline to maintain excellence when everything felt impossible</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>And I didn't stop there.</p>
                            <p>I pursued a degree in <strong>Biomedical Engineering</strong> with a minor in <strong>Mathematics</strong>—studying the very systems that had both failed and saved me. I graduated with a <strong>3.8 GPA</strong>.</p>
                            <p>I was accepted to <strong>Carnegie Mellon University</strong>, one of the world's top engineering schools.</p>
                            <p>Everything was set. The path was clear. Graduate school. Research. A prestigious career.</p>
                            <p class="text-gold fw-bold">And then I made a choice that shocked everyone.</p>
                        </div>

                        <!-- The Decision -->
                        <div class="mb-5">
                            <h2 class="text-gold fw-bold mb-4">The Decision</h2>
                            <p class="lead">I deferred Carnegie Mellon.</p>
                            <p>Why would someone who fought so hard for a future walk away from a guaranteed path to success?</p>
                            <p>Because surviving cancer taught me something most people never learn:</p>
                            <p class="lead text-gold"><strong>Tomorrow isn't guaranteed. If you have a dream, chase it now.</strong></p>
                            <p>My dream wasn't to sit in a lab. It was to <strong>build something that helps others achieve their impossible</strong>.</p>
                            <p>I founded <strong>Marceau Solutions</strong> to create AI automation tools for people who are:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Fitness influencers trying to scale their impact without burning out</li>
                                <li>Amazon sellers drowning in inventory management and reviews</li>
                                <li>MedTech companies buried under regulatory compliance</li>
                                <li>Job seekers preparing for career-changing interviews</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>People who are fighting their own battles. People who refuse to settle. People like me.</p>
                        </div>

                        <!-- The Mission -->
                        <div class="mb-5">
                            <h2 class="text-gold fw-bold mb-4">The Mission</h2>
                            <p class="lead">The fastest way to achieve your own goals is to help others achieve theirs.</p>
                            <p>That's not just a philosophy—it's the foundation of Marceau Solutions.</p>
                            <p>I build AI tools that give people their time back. Their focus back. Their energy back. So they can pour it into what truly matters.</p>
                            <p>Every automation script I write. Every workflow I optimize. Every hour I save for a client.</p>
                            <p class="text-gold fw-bold">It's not just business. It's personal.</p>
                            <p>Because I know what it's like to fight when the odds are stacked against you. I know what it's like to rebuild yourself from scratch. And I know what it's like to refuse to let obstacles define your future.</p>
