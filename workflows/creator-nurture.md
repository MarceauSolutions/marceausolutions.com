**SMS:**
Hey {firstName}! Your FitAI Studio demo access is ready. Try it here: fitai.marceausolutions.com/frontend/index.html — Upload a video and see AI captions, jump cuts, and multi-platform export in action. — William

**Email Subject:** Your FitAI Studio Access Is Ready
**Email Body:**
Hi {firstName},

Welcome to FitAI Studio! Here's your demo access:

**[Launch FitAI Studio](https://fitai.marceausolutions.com/frontend/index.html)**

Quick start guide:
1. Upload any fitness video (under 5 min works best for demo)
2. Try the AI caption generator — 10 styles to choose from
3. Use the jump cut tool to remove dead air automatically
4. Export for any platform (TikTok, IG Reels, YouTube, etc.)

This is the same tool I use to cut my editing time from 3 hours to 15 minutes per video.

Questions? Just reply to this email.

## Day 1 (Email)

**Subject:** How I went from 3 hours to 15 minutes per video
**Body:**
Hi {firstName},

When I was posting 5x a week, video editing was killing me. Every video took 2-3 hours of cutting, adding captions, reformatting for different platforms.

I'm an engineer by training (biomedical, actually), so I built automation tools:
- **AI jump cuts** that detect and remove dead air
- **Auto-captions** that actually look good (10 styles, not just white text)
- **One-click export** for 9 platforms (correct aspect ratios, durations, formats)

Now the same video goes from raw footage to platform-ready in 15 minutes.

I initially built this just for myself. Then other creators started asking how I was posting so consistently without burning out.

That's why I opened up FitAI Studio.

## Day 2 (SMS)

{firstName}, did you try the AI caption generator yet? Pro tip: the "Bold Gradient" style gets 23% higher engagement than standard white captions in our testing. Try it on your next video: fitai.marceausolutions.com — William

---

## Day 3 (Email)

**Subject:** How I post 5x/week without burning out
**Body:**
Hi {firstName},

Here's my actual weekly workflow:

**Monday:** Film 2-3 long-form videos (90 min total shooting)
**Tuesday:** Run videos through FitAI — AI does jump cuts, captions, reformatting (45 min of review)
**Wednesday-Sunday:** Auto-scheduled posts go out across TikTok, IG, YouTube, Facebook, LinkedIn

That's it. 2.5 hours of work produces 5+ pieces of content across 5 platforms.

The secret isn't working harder — it's having systems that do the repetitive work for you.

The Managed plan ($297/mo) includes content calendar management, so I set up the same system for you:
- AI handles editing
- Calendar handles scheduling
- You focus on creating and coaching

## Day 4 (SMS)

{firstName}, here's what FitAI processing actually looks like: raw footage goes in → AI detects pauses, filler words, and dead air → smart jump cuts applied → captions generated → export for 9 platforms. All in under 5 minutes. Have you tried uploading a video yet? — William

---

## Day 5 (Email)

**Subject:** 3 features you might have missed in FitAI Studio
**Body:**
Hi {firstName},

Most people only try the basic caption tool. Here are 3 features that save the most time:

**1. Filler Word Removal**
AI detects "um," "uh," "like," "you know" and removes them automatically. Makes your content sound polished without manual editing.

**2. Exercise Recognition**
Upload a training video and AI identifies the exercises being performed. Automatically generates exercise labels and rep counts for overlay.

**3. Multi-Platform Export**
One video → 9 platform-optimized versions. TikTok (9:16), YouTube (16:9), Instagram Feed (1:1), Stories (9:16), LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Threads. All with correct durations and aspect ratios.
