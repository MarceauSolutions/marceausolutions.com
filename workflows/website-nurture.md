## Day 1 (Email)

**Subject:** The 3 things every SMB website needs in 2026
**Body:**
Hi {firstName},

After building websites for HVAC companies, fire performers, fitness brands, and more — here are the 3 things that actually matter:

**1. Mobile-first design (not mobile-friendly — mobile FIRST)**
65% of local searches happen on phones. If your site isn't designed for thumbs first, you're losing customers before they even see your services.

**2. Clear call-to-action above the fold**
Within 3 seconds, a visitor should know: what you do, why you're the right choice, and how to contact you. No scrolling required.

**3. Page speed under 2 seconds**
Google penalizes slow sites. Most WordPress sites load in 4-8 seconds. Our hand-coded sites load in under 1.5 seconds.

These three things alone can increase your lead conversion by 30-50%.

## Day 2 (SMS)

{firstName}, check out what we built for Flames of Passion — a luxury fire performance company in Naples: flamesofpassion.marceausolutions.com

Custom booking form, masonry gallery, animated fire particles. Every site we build is one-of-a-kind, no templates. What could we build for {businessName}? — William

## Day 3 (Email)

**Subject:** 68% of customers judge your business by your website
**Body:**
Hi {firstName},

Stanford research shows that 75% of users judge a company's credibility based on its website design. And 68% say they won't trust a business with a poorly designed site.

For local businesses like {businessName}, this is even more critical:
- 97% of consumers search online for local businesses
- 78% of local mobile searches result in an offline purchase
- But 28% of small businesses still don't have a website

Your website isn't a brochure — it's your hardest-working salesperson. It works 24/7, handles unlimited visitors, and never takes a day off.

The question isn't whether you can afford a professional website. It's whether you can afford not to have one.

## Day 4 (SMS)

{firstName}, here's a before-and-after: SW Florida Comfort HVAC had no website. We built them one + integrated Voice AI. Result? $12,400 in new revenue their first month. Their site: swfloridacomfort.com

What would even half that do for {businessName}? — William

---

## Day 5 (Email)

**Subject:** 5 signs your website is costing you customers
**Body:**
Hi {firstName},

Quick checklist — if any of these sound familiar, you're leaving money on the table:

1. **It takes more than 3 seconds to load** — 53% of mobile users leave if a page takes longer
2. **You can't find your contact info without scrolling** — If they have to hunt for your phone number, they'll call a competitor instead
3. **It's not mobile-responsive** — Google now ranks mobile-friendliness as a core factor
4. **There's no clear call-to-action** — "Welcome to our site!" isn't a CTA. "Get a Free Quote" is.
5. **You built it yourself on Wix/Squarespace** — DIY sites average 4-8 second load times and limited SEO

If you checked 3 or more, a website rebuild could be your highest-ROI investment this year.

{firstName}, here's what a typical website project looks like with us:
