## Day 1 (Email)

**Subject:** How a Naples HVAC company captured $12K with AI
**Body:**
Hi {firstName},

Quick story: William George runs SW Florida Comfort HVAC here in Naples. He was losing 30-40% of his calls during busy season. After-hours emergencies went straight to voicemail.

We deployed Voice AI that answers every call within 2 rings, 24/7. Natural conversation — customers don't even realize it's AI.

Results in 30 days:
- 312 calls handled (95.5% answer rate vs. 60% before)
- 18 new customers acquired
- 47 appointments booked without human intervention
- $12,400 in new revenue

His quote: "Best $8K I ever spent."

## Day 2 (SMS)

Quick question {firstName} — how many calls did {businessName} miss last week? Most business owners don't track this, but it's usually 20-40% during peak hours. That's real money walking out the door. Happy to show you our tracking dashboard if you're curious. — William

## Day 3 (Email)

**Subject:** Voice AI vs. answering services — the real comparison
**Body:**
Hi {firstName},

A lot of business owners compare Voice AI to traditional answering services. Here's how they actually stack up:

| Feature | Answering Service | Voice AI |
|---------|------------------|----------|
| Cost | $800-2,600/mo | $200/mo |
| Availability | Business hours (usually) | 24/7/365 |
| Answer time | 30-60 seconds | <10 seconds |
| Booking | Takes messages | Books directly into calendar |
| CRM integration | Manual | Automatic |
| Consistency | Varies by person | 100% consistent |
| Scalability | Needs more staff | Handles unlimited calls |

The HVAC client was paying $2,600/mo for a receptionist doing 60% phone work. Now they pay $200/mo and have better results.

## Day 4 (SMS)

{firstName}, here's a real conversation from our HVAC client's Voice AI:

Customer: "Hi, I need someone to look at my AC."
AI: "I can help! Can I get your name and address?"
Customer: "John Smith, 123 Main St, Naples."
AI: "I have tomorrow at 2 PM or Thursday at 10 AM. Which works?"
Customer: "Thursday at 10."
AI: "Booked! You'll get a confirmation text shortly."

47 appointments booked like this in the first month — no human needed. Want to hear how it sounds for {businessName}? — William

## Day 5 (Email)

**Subject:** 3 automation workflows that pay for themselves in 30 days
**Body:**
Hi {firstName},

Beyond Voice AI, here are 3 automations that immediately save money:

**1. Lead Capture → SMS Follow-up (ROI: 2-3 weeks)**
Every form submission or call triggers an immediate SMS confirmation + 7-day follow-up sequence. Businesses that follow up within 5 minutes are 21x more likely to convert.

**2. Appointment Reminders (ROI: 1 week)**
Automated SMS reminders 24 hrs and 1 hr before appointments. Reduces no-shows by 30-50%.

**3. Review Requests (ROI: 2 weeks)**
Automated "How was your experience?" texts after service completion. Happy customers get a Google review link. Unhappy ones get routed to you privately.

All three can be running within a week. Most businesses see payback in under a month.

{firstName}, here's what the setup process looks like:

Week 1: Discovery + voice flow design
Week 2: AI training + testing
Week 3: Soft launch (AI answers, you monitor)
Week 4: Full deployment + optimization
